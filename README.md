Blockchain-based secure online voting system

In blockchain, votes can be "transacted" as easily as digital coins, as a bitcoin. Each voter gets a digital identity, joins the network and registers their preferred choice in an election or referendum. This vote is recorded and added to a chain of blocks in the system.
